    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Step 1: Registration and Bracket Creation</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">First, if you haven't already, please create your bracket on Yahoo! Fantasy by following this link:
        <a href="#" class="text-blue-500 underline">Insert Yahoo! Fantasy League Link</a>. Make sure to note down your
        bracket name or ID as you'll need it for the registration form.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Step 2: Filling Out the Registration Form</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Once you have your bracket set up, please fill out our registration form here: <a href="#"
            class="text-blue-500 underline">Insert Registration Form Link</a>. In this form, you'll need to provide your
        name, email, Yahoo! Fantasy bracket name/ID, and confirm the number of brackets you're entering. This is crucial
        for ensuring your entry is correctly recorded and matched with your payment.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Step 3: Payment</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">The entry fee is $50 for one bracket or $100 for three brackets. Please send your payment via
        <strong>[Preferred Payment Platform]</strong> to <strong>[Your Payment Information]</strong>. In the payment
        description or note, kindly include "March Madness - [Your Name] - [Bracket ID]" to help us match your payment
        to your bracket(s) seamlessly.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Step 4: Confirmation</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">After we receive both your completed registration form and payment, we'll send you a confirmation
        email. This email will confirm your participation, payment, and provide you with any additional information
        needed as we approach the tournament start.</p>

    <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Our Charity Goal</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">This year, we're excited to announce that 60% of all proceeds will be donated to <strong>[Charity
            Name]</strong>, supporting <strong>[Charity Cause]</strong>. Not only does your participation offer a chance
        to win great prizes, but it also contributes to a fantastic cause.</p>
